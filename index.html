                <p>
                    Recession is a slowdown or <a>a massive contraction in economic activities.</a> A significant fall in spending generally leads to a recession.
                  It's a <mark class="blue">significant decline </mark> in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in <em>real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales.</em>

                    <a>Recessions are bad for capital as well as labor.</a> Corporate profits drop as sagging demand and severance drive up unit costs. Overly indebted companies may default on their debt, driving up borrowing costs or causing credit to evaporate entirely for others in similar straits.

          <li>How many recessions have there been?</li>
            </p>
                <p>
                    The world economy has experienced four global recessions over the past seven decades: in <mark class="blue">1975, 1982, 1991, and 2009.</mark> During each of these episodes, annual real per capita global gross domestic product contracted, and this contraction was accompanied by weakening of other key indicators of global economic activity.
                </p>                 
                <p>
                   A prolonged recession causes depression, lasting too long, with impacts worse than those observed during the economic slowdown. The most common example of a recession and depression is the global recession of the <a>2008 financial crisis and the Great Depression of the 1930s,</a> respectively.

                <p>
                   The <mark class="green">good news</mark> is that recessions generally haven't been very long. Our analysis of 10 cycles since 1950 shows that recessions have <a>lasted between eight and 18 months,</a> with the average spanning about 11 months. For those directly affected by job loss or business closures, that can feel like an eternity.   </p>            <p>

                    <li>What is Yield curve and how it help to predict recession?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    One of the most closely watched indicators of an impending recession is the <a>“yield curve.”</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    A yield is simply the interest rate on a bond, or Treasury. These Treasuries have differing lengths of duration, known as their maturity. Some bonds last one month; some last 30 years. The curve, therefore, <a>compares how those interest rates change over time.</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Typically, the interest rate – how the U.S. government issuing these securities compensates investors for risks – is higher on a bond with a longer maturity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a>“The yield curve is positive sloping – most of the time.”</a>
                </p>
  <p>When the <mark class="orange">yield curve inverts</mark>, however, the curve becomes downward sloping. <a><em>This inversion means investors are demanding a higher yield for Treasuries of shorter durations.</em></a> In this case, they think it’s riskier to hold their bond over the shorter-term.  A phenomenon widely taken as a signal of a potential economic downturn.
    </p>
  <p>The Bottom Line is a yield curve that inverts for an extended period of time appears to be a <a>more reliable recession signal</a> than one that inverts briefly, whichever yield spread you use as a proxy.</p>
    <p><mark class="green">IMPORTANT: An inverted Treasury yield curve is one of the most reliable leading indicators of a recession.</mark></p>
